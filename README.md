# PDF-to-MP3
## PDF to MP3 Converter

### Summary
This program was made for personal use but after talking to others about it, I decided to share it. 

Currently the following can be converted to mp3:
-Website Articles
-PDF files
-docx files
-Txt files

### How to install
To use this program you can use the compiled exe or run the python file directly. The exe runs natively on Windows but you will need to install wine to run it on Mac or Linux. If you choose to install python, download the latest version from the official website along with pip, included in the official python installer, to make installing and updating libraries simple. After installing open a powershell, cmd, or terminal window in the folder holding the script, then run "pip install -r requirements.txt" to install all dependencies. After that it will be ready for use. Â

### How to Update the Theme
If you are using the exe you'll only have access to the default theme but if you are using the python script, I have configured a dark theme as well. To change the theme, go into the code and comment out, all themes besides the the one you want to use. If you want to create your own theme add RGB values the "Custom Theme" section and comment out the other themes.
